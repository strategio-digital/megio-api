# Megio API

Megio API is a JavaScript & TypeScript library that can be used for REST API communication with the Megio panel. The library contains all the necessary methods - authentication, creating data, reading, editing, deleting, working with permissions, etc. The strict typing of this library will provide you with excellent support in the IDE. Thanks to this support, you will not have to explore the entire REST API of the Megio panel, but the methods will be offered to you directly while writing the code.
